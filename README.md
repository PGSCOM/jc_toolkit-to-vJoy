## Information

Joy-Con Toolkit is a downloadable program that allows users to modify the digital appearance of their official Nintendo Switch Joy-Con and Pro Controllers via Bluetooth connection

Additional features include: IR camera captures, NFC reading, saving custom colors, backing up SPI flash, calibrating analog sticks, and more

## v5.2.0 Changelog

Near Infrared Camera:
* Add live configuration when streaming
* Add many new IR settings (de-noise, led intensity, strobe lights, etc)
* Change custom IR sensor registers
* Auto exposure mode (This is done manually, so it's experimental. Expect bugs).

User Calibration Editing:
* Add Accelerometer/Gyroscope user calibration editing
* Add Stick device factory parameters editing. Helps when you have drifting issues, that can't be fixed by calibrating the stick. Just raise the deadzone value.

Debugging / Troubleshooting:
* Add 2 command line options:
* -d: Dumps the communication packets into a log text file
* -f: Forces the app to not check for connection again. Helps in some cases that the app reports that the controller was disconnected.

Others:
* Organize the IR/Playground/Calibration panels a little better
* Many bugfixes and optimizationsbugfixes/optimizations
